#' Estimating correlation between SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome effect sizes
#'
#' \code{est_lambda} is a function which allows users to obtain an
#' \emph{unbiased} estimate for \emph{lambda}, a term used to describe the
#' correlation between the SNP-outcome and SNP-exposure effect sizes, using a conditional log-likelihood approach. This
#' correlation is affected by the number of overlapping samples between the two
#' GWASs and the correlation between the exposure and the outcome. Thus, when
#' using the function \code{mr_simss}, if the fraction of overlap and the
#' correlation between exposure and outcome are unknown, it is recommended to
#' employ \code{est_lambda} and use the value returned from \code{est_lambda} in
#' \code{mr_simss}.
#' \strong{Note:} For greater accuracy in the estimation of
#' \emph{lambda}, it is advisable to use summary  statistics of the entire set of
#' \emph{unpruned} SNPs from the exposure and outcome GWASs.
#'
#' @param data A data frame to be inputted by the user containing summary
#'  statistics from the exposure and outcome GWASs. It must have at least five
#'  columns with column names \code{SNP}, \code{beta.exposure},
#'  \code{beta.outcome}, \code{se.exposure}, and \code{se.outcome}. Each row
#'  must correspond to a unique SNP, identified by \code{SNP}.
#' @param z.threshold A value which is used to obtain a subset of SNPs which have
#'  absolute \emph{z}-statistics for both exposure and outcome GWASs less than
#'  this value. The method then assumes that both of the true SNP-outcome and
#'  SNP-exposure effect sizes of each SNP in this subset are approximately 0.
#'  The default setting is \code{z.threshold=0.5}.
#'
#' @return A value which is an estimate of \emph{lambda}, the correlation between the SNP-outcome and SNP-exposure effect sizes, using a conditional log-likelihood approach. Note that this estimate is unbiased but potentially has a high degree of variance.

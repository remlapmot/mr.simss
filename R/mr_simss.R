#' MR-SimSS main function
#'
#' \code{mr_simss} is the main function for the method, \strong{MR-SimSS}, which
#' is a method based on simulated sample splitting in order to alleviate
#' \emph{Winner's Curse} bias in MR causal effect estimates. It also takes into
#' account sample overlap between the exposure and outcome GWASs. It uses GWAS
#' summary statistics and works in combination with existing MR methods, such as
#' IVW and MR-RAPS.
#'
#' @param data A data frame to be inputted by the user containing summary
#'  statistics from the exposure and outcome GWASs. It must have at least five
#'  columns with column names \code{SNP}, \code{beta.exposure},
#'  \code{beta.outcome}, \code{se.exposure} and \code{se.outcome}. Each row must
#'  correspond to a unique SNP, identified by \code{SNP}.
#' @param mr_method A string which specifies the MR method that MR-SimSS works in
#'  combination with. It is possible to use any method outputted in the list
#'  \code{TwoSampleMR::mr_method_list()$obj}. However, it is currently advised
#'  that the user chooses \code{"mr_ivw"} or \code{"mr_raps"}. The default
#'  setting is \code{mr_method="mr_ivw"}.
#' @param threshold A numerical value which specifies the threshold used to
#'  select instrument SNPs for MR at each iteration. The default setting is
#'  \code{threshold=5e-8}. This value must be between 0 and 1.
#' @param n.iter A numerical value which specifies the number of iterations of
#'  the method, i.e. the number of times sample splits are randomly simulated.
#'  The default setting is \code{n.iter=1000}.
#' @param splits A numerical value that must be equal to 2 or 3, indicating
#'  whether splits of 2 or 3 should be simulated. It is recommended that in the
#'  case of no overlap between the two GWASs that splits of 2 should be used
#'  while in the presence of overlap, especially full overlap, splits of 3
#'  should be used. The default setting is \code{splits=3}.
#' @param pi A numerical value which determines the fraction of the first split
#'  in both the 2 and 3 split approaches. This is the fraction that will be used
#'  for SNP selection. The default setting is \code{pi=0.5}. This value must be
#'  between 0 and 1.
#' @param pi2 A numerical value which determines the fraction of the second split
#'  in the 3 split approach. The default setting is \code{pi2=0.5}. This value
#'  must be between 0 and 1.
#' @param subset A logical which permits the user to perform this method with
#'  either the original complete set of SNPs or a subset of SNPs in order to
#'  reduce computational time. The default setting is \code{subset=TRUE}.
#' @param sub.cut A numerical value required if \code{subset=TRUE}, which ensures
#'  that for a single iteration of our method, the number of instruments
#'  selected if the full set of SNPs is used and the number of instruments if
#'  merely the subset is used will be equal with probability at least
#'  \code{1-sub.cut}.
#' @param est.lambda A logical which allows the user to specify if they want to use
#'  the function, \code{est_lambda}, to obtain an estimate for \emph{lambda}, a
#'  term used to describe the correlation between the SNP-outcome and
#'  SNP-exposure effect sizes, with the data stored in \code{data}. This correlation is affected by the number of
#'  overlapping samples between the two GWASs and the correlation between the
#'  exposure and the outcome. Thus, it is recommended to use \code{est_lambda}
#'  if the fraction of overlap and the correlation between exposure and outcome
#'  are unknown. The default setting is \code{est.lambda=TRUE}.
#' @param n.exposure A numerical value to be specified by the user which is equal
#'  to the number of individuals that were in the exposure GWAS. It should be
#'  specified by the user if \code{est.lambda=FALSE}. The default setting is
#'  \code{n.exposure=1}.
#' @param n.outcome A numerical value to be specified by the user which is equal
#'  to the number of individuals that were in the outcome GWAS. It should be
#'  specified by the user if \code{est.lambda=FALSE}. The default setting is
#'  \code{n.outcome=1}.
#' @param n.overlap A numerical value to be specified by the user which is equal
#'  to the number of individuals that were in both the exposure and outcome
#'  GWAS. It should be specified by the user if \code{est.lambda=FALSE}. The
#'  default setting is \code{n.overlap=1}. The function requires that this value
#'  is less than or equal to the minimum of \code{n.exposure} and
#'  \code{n.outcome}.
#' @param cor.xy A numerical value to be specified by the user which is equal to
#'  the observed correlation between the exposure and the outcome. This value
#'  must be between -1 and 1. It should be specified by the user if
#'  \code{est.lambda=FALSE}. The default setting is \code{cor.xy=0}. If this
#'  value is unknown, the user is encouraged to use the function
#'  \code{est_lambda}.
#' @param lambda.thresh A value which is used when estimating \emph{lambda} to
#'  obtain a subset of SNPs which have absolute \emph{z}-statistics for both exposure and outcome GWASs less than
#'  this value. The method then assumes that both of the true SNP-outcome and
#'  SNP-exposure effect sizes of each SNP in this subset are approximately 0.
#'  The default setting is \code{lambda.thresh=0.5}.
#'
#' @return A list containing two elements, \code{summary} and \code{results}.
#'  \code{summary} is a data frame with one row which outputs \code{b}, the
#'  estimated causal effect of exposure on outcome obtained using the
#'  \strong{MR-SimSS} method, as well as \code{se}, the associated standard
#'  error of this estimate and \code{pval}, corresponding \emph{p}-value. It
#'  also contains the MR method used, the average number of instrument SNPs used
#'  in each iteration and the number of iterations used. \code{results} is a
#'  data frame which contains the output from each iteration. It is in a similar
#'  style as the output from using the function \code{mr} from the
#'  \code{TwoSampleMR} R package.
